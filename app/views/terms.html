You and PayWhere will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.
								</p>
								<p>
									(a) <b>Law and Forum for Disputes</b> - You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against PayWhere must be resolved by a court located in Singapore, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Singapore for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
								</p>
								<p>
									(b) <b>Arbitration Option</b> - For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than S$10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
								</p>
								<p>
									(c) <b>Improperly Filed Claims</b> - All claims you bring against PayWhere must be resolved in accordance with Section 15.6 of this Agreement. All claims filed or brought contrary to Section 15 of this Agreement shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to Section 15 of this Agreement, PayWhere may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to S$3000, provided that PayWhere has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.

								</p>
							</li>
							<li class="list-alpha">
								<h4>Severability, Waiver</h4>
								<p>
									If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. In such case, Parties will include one or more new provisions in the Agreement, which enables them, if possible, to reach the same or a similar result as envisaged by the stricken provision.
